                            This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a
                            troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                            slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow–catcher; but the mass of animals
                            was too great. The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then
                            deafening
                            bellowings. There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction,
                            nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam
                            could contain.
                        </p>

                            The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had
                            the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically
                            until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.
                            Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal
                            of revolvers upon them.

                            "What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as
                            if they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this
                            mishap in his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into
                            this herd of beasts!"
